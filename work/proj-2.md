Started as a 3-person group project for Introduction to Artificial Intelligence 
with the challenge of creating an algorithm that enabled PAC-MAN to complete a 
traditional maze having a time constraint for calculations.

I took the responsibility of developing all the logic and strategy, which 
resulted in one of the most complex yet efficient algorithms, layered with map 
topography and situation analysis, strategy advisory and validation. It scored 
consistently about 20% above the second place. Then a small bug in the maze 
analysis in the last evaluation undercut our grade. My solution: delivering a 
second individual project, created from scratch in 3 days (this project) with an 
inefficient algorithm, but a new strategy with very good overall results 
(improved final class grade!) and very promising ones if efficiency is improved 
or time constraints are relaxed.
