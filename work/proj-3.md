Version 1 started as a 3-person group project for Introduction to Artificial 
Intelligence with the challenge of creating an algorithm that enabled PAC-MAN 
to complete a traditional maze having a time constraint for calculations.

I took the responsibility of developing the logic and strategy, which resulted 
in one of the most complex yet efficient algorithms of the class, layered with 
map topography and situation analysis, strategy advisory and validation.
It scored consistently about 20% above the second place. Then a small bug in 
the maze analysis in the last evaluation undercut our grade. Enter version 2.

Version 2 was an individual delivery of a second project for grade 
re-evaluation, created from scratch in 3 days. The algorithm was not the most 
efficient one, but the new strategy yielded very good overall results 
(improving final class grade!).
