The Units Project is a powerful Domain Specific Language for creating all kinds 
of Units that offers an interface that guarantees checked operations between them.

**The "Double Trouble"**

Why isn't the type Double enough? When dealing with units or quantities of a 
specific dimension in a General Purpose programming language there is an obvious 
limitation. There is no way to distinguish two variables aside from their names. 
And when operating with units, adding or multiplying yields different results, 
one maintains the dimension the other does not. And what if the SI units are not 
enough? And what if you need to create a new base unit and derived other units 
from it? And what about prefix multipliers? The Double Trouble DSL allows you to 
create all of this very easily. As a simple example, the code bellow creates 17 
prefixed types/units with 169 different combinations to calculate area with 
equivalent (same dimension) units.

```
units {
  meter "m";
  yard "yd";
  fathom "ftm";
  area "m^2" : meter * meter;
  length [meter] : (1.09361) yard | (0.546807) fathom;
}
prefixes {
  Mega "M" : 10^6;
  kilo "k" : 10^3;
  pico "p" : 10^-12;
}
```
