This is a very personal project to me.

When the need of studying again at 30 years old came to be, the decision on a 
Computer Engineering course was heavily influenced by an Excel spreadsheet I've 
created and had been improving for years. The complexity of information and 
calculations presented in a quite simple way, was a matter of pride to me.

So when the opportunity was presented in the University of choosing any project 
theme, the decision was very easy to make.

This 2-person group project from the classes of Databases and Human-Computer 
Interaction, is the start of the next step for that spreadsheet.
My contribution was heavier in the Conceptual an Relational Model creation, 
and later I was responsible for implementing all the Database, and a simple 
Windows Forms interface to showcase its use.
I also participated heavily on the Android Mock App design.

I hope this is the starting point of actually taking my spreadsheet to a whole 
new level and launch an App into the market.
