The Rules Test Template was an initiative of making rules testing available for 
all teams in Feedzai using the AML Solution, especially the Customer Success 
teams.

Previously, the rules testing strategy and framework was mainly done to fit 
each project needs. It was necessary to access multiple systems to verify that 
the expected outcomes. These tests were very difficult to maintain and many 
times executed manually by changing the values necessary for each test or using 
scripts.

The Rules Test Template completely automates the process from end to end. Even 
a non-technical team member can now create a CSV with only the fields that are 
relevant to test the rule (usually 4 to 8 instead of hundreds) and specify in a 
builder pattern the expected results and intended validations. Because multiple 
systems and components are exercised throughout these tests, this has become 
the standard AML Solution System-tests Framework.
